Combat automation webpage for Stars of the City TTRPG: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BnU-VNWkLPjhtYfSfpaErkzdUd_LYk2deGrSQgsatXk/edit?tab=t.lqyl0omvfjmw.

This is originally hosted on @TrueQueenOfRose's fanmade spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10MbckfeeXsWCiMkebgmEqB6T3j0Jn2JzCkb9VrTKo64/edit?gid=0#gid=0) using Google App Scripts, I ported it over to Github Pages usign ChatGPT, it likely that it has issues that the original code does not have. I will not be troubleshooting these.
